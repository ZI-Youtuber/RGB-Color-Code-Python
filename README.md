# RGB-Color-Code-Python
These are all of the colours that you can use in your next python project. 

The way you would want to formatt this code is by putting the color name then put this symbol (=) then put the code in then copy and paste the code in.

If you want to make a new color feel free to experment with different number codes to make new colors

There is no need to worry because I will formatt the code the same way you would in a python project.

Look into rgb color code.png for all of the color codes but don't add the RGB part. 

 I'm going to formatt the main.py it like in the png file but will be in a proper formatt like it would be in a python project so it will be like : color(number) = (number code)

If you want to see how the color looks like then look in the png file and decide nothing is confusing because I have put them with the color number
