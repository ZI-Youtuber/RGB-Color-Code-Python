# RGB-Color-Code-Python
These are all of the colours that you can use in your next python project. 

The way you would want to formatt this code is by putting the color name then put this symbol (=) then put the code in then copy and paste the code in.

If you want to make a new color feel free to experment with different number codes to make new colors

There is no need to worry because I will formatt the code the same way you would in a python project.
